# Sound-Manga-Reader-Godot
Offline manga reader for manga with sound enhancements features (made with Godot)

Based on the [Sound Manga Reader](https://gitlab.com/papjul/sound-manga-reader/) project.

Since the original project doesn't support Windows (except through emulation), I created this project to be able to read the Umineko manga with sound on PC (and also to learn how to use Godot)

OPUS Codec is not supported by the Godot Engine, so you'll have to use Vorbis instead.

All of the Umineko manga packs should be supported (though the audio packs need to be transcoded to Ogg Vorbis)
